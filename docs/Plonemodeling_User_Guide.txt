Instructions for installing and configuring Plonemodeling add-on

Installing Plonemodeling
	Install boto
	Add AWS credentials to ~/.boto
	Enable support for Dexterity Content Types in Site Setup
	Under eggs in buildout.cfg, add the line 'cs492.plonemodeling'
	Add <URL> to find-links
	Run buildout

Once Plonemodeling is installed, all that is left to do is to create Virtual Machine and Job Content Types.

A Virtual Machine should be created first, as a Job needs a Virtual Machine associated to it. Creating Virtual Machines and Jobs is simply a matter of filling out their respect forms.
	
To access a view displaying all the jobs that currently exist append @@jobs_view to the URL of the Plone site's root page.
